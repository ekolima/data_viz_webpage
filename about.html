            <h3>Past</h3>
            <p>Born back in 1998, spent most of my life trying to find what I want to be the best at, ranging from pianist, tennis player and *drum rolls* developer. Finally, decided to combine technology with business in my studies, but at the end technology conquered my heart. Also, I've spent a fair amount of time, in the pre covid era, travelling abroad leading to this top two destinations: Verona üáÆüáπ and Edinburgh üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø </p>

            <h3>Present</h3>
            <p>In desperate search of free time, while I work full time as a Data Scientist and study part time towards a Master's Degree in Computer Science. My professional and academic interests include machine learning, natural language processing and decision sciences. Currently I spend around 70% of my time coding in Python, R and SQL, but my real pain point is Excel.</p>

            <h3>Future</h3>
            <p>Even though I have absolutely no clue about what's coming next, there's a long bucket list of things to do and opportunities to consider. For sure, I want to live abroad, as I really like to interact with people from different cultural backgrounds and quality of life ain't good in Greece (see here). Also, maybe I will pursue a PhD and do research (who knows that's a huge milestone!)</p>
